### Game Name

The Chainsaw Man: Blob Game

### Project Description

- This game is inspired by an ongoing anime entitled, Chainsaw Man.

- The player is Denji (yellow player blob), a half-human and half-devil, who tries to achieve his life goals by defeating devil monsters (dark brown enemy blobs).

- In order to defeat them, the player is tasked to collect as many blood drops as possible (small red circles) in order to increase Denji's size so that he can defeat other monsters who are smaller than him.

- 2 power-ups can be collected by Denji:

  - [1] Pochita Power-Up - player will be immune to monsters
  - [2] Chainsaw Power-Up - player's speed will increase two times faster

- If a devil monster eats Denji because it is larger than him, then, the game will end.
